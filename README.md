### Introduction and motivation
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. An additional goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The function that is written should produce a tidy data set as described below.  

### Files used and data structure
The data are a pre-formed data set obtained from the [University of California - Irvine Machine Learning Repository][UCI link]. The data used in this function are from collected from accelerometers in smartphones, 

Within the zip file downloaded are the following files:
* activity_labels.txt - text file descriptions of the activities monitored for this data set

#### Activities monitored in the data set
* Walking
* Walking up stairs
* Walking down stairs
* Sitting
* Standing 
* Laying
